All significant studio projects of the students, particularly those of the higher levels including the final year terminal projects are evaluated by the ‘Jury’ system. Under this system, a jury of external examiners comprising of the faculty members as well as at least one or two well known architects from the profession is constituted to listen to the presentation of the students, deliberate with them and pass judgment on the standard and quality of the work presented. The students are graded largely on the basis of such open jury evaluations.
