The Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) program of the Department of Architecture involves a wide range of disciplines in the fields of arts, sciences and engineering. The diversified theoretical courses are aimed at developing an understanding of the bases of architectural design problems. The studio sessions are then available for application of these knowledge and understandings to practical design problems. Thus, design studio works constitute a very important aspect of the B. Arch. program and continues from Design Studios I & II in the first year to Design Studios IX-X in the fifth or final year.
